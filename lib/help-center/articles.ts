# Choosing the Right Flag Size

The right flag size ensures proper display and longevity.

## Recommended Flag Sizes by Pole Height:

| Pole Height | Flag Size | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 15-20 ft | 3x5 ft | Standard residential |
| 20-25 ft | 4x6 ft | Larger homes |
| 25-30 ft | 5x8 ft | Commercial/large properties |
| 30-40 ft | 6x10 ft | Commercial buildings |

## General Guidelines:
- Flag length should be 1/4 to 1/3 of pole height
- Larger flags create more wind resistance
- Consider your local wind conditions
- Multiple flags require additional consideration

## Flying Two Flags:
When flying two flags, use our Double Flag Harness (DUA-Harness) and size both flags appropriately. Learn more in our [Two Flags Guide](/help-center/getting-started/how-to-fly-two-flags).

# My Flag Is Fraying ‚Äì What Can I Do?

Flag fraying is normal wear, but you can extend flag life with proper care.

## Why Flags Fray:
- **Wind exposure** - Constant flapping causes wear
- **UV damage** - Sun breaks down fabric over time
- **Weather** - Rain, snow, and ice accelerate wear
- **Quality** - Lower quality flags wear faster

## Prevention Tips:

### 1. Choose Quality Flags
- Made in USA flags last longer
- Nylon for most conditions
- Polyester for high-wind areas
- Heavier weight = longer life

### 2. Proper Care
- Lower during severe weather
- Bring in during winter (optional)
- Wash gently when soiled
- Dry completely before storing

### 3. Rotate Flags
- Keep 2-3 flags in rotation
- Reduces wear on any single flag
- Always have a backup ready

## Repair Options:

### Minor Fraying:
- Trim loose threads with scissors
- Apply fabric glue to prevent spreading
- Sew reinforcement stitching if skilled

### Major Damage:
- Retire flag respectfully
- Order replacement flag
- Consider upgrading to heavier weight

## Flag Retirement:
Worn flags should be retired respectfully. Many VFW and American Legion posts offer flag retirement ceremonies.

**Need a replacement flag?** Browse our [Flag Collection](/collections/flags) or check our [Flag Warranty Coverage](/help-center/warranty/flag-warranty-coverage).

## Expected Lifespan:
- **Residential use**: 6-12 months
- **Commercial use**: 3-6 months
- **High-wind areas**: 3-6 months
- **Protected areas**: 12-18 months

# How to Clean and Care for Your Flag

Proper care extends your flag's life and keeps it looking beautiful.

## Cleaning Your Flag:

### Hand Washing (Recommended):
1. **Fill basin** with cold water and mild detergent
2. **Soak flag** for 15-30 minutes
3. **Gently agitate** - Don't scrub or wring
4. **Rinse thoroughly** with cold water
5. **Air dry** - Hang or lay flat, never machine dry

### Machine Washing (If Necessary):
1. **Use gentle cycle** with cold water
2. **Mild detergent** only
3. **Wash alone** - Don't mix with other items
4. **Remove promptly** when cycle ends
5. **Air dry** - Never use dryer

## Stain Removal:
- **Dirt/mud** - Let dry, brush off, then wash
- **Bird droppings** - Soak in cold water first
- **Mildew** - Use oxygen bleach (not chlorine)
- **Stubborn stains** - Professional cleaning recommended

## Storage:

### Short-term (Seasonal):
- Clean and dry completely
- Fold properly (triangle fold)
- Store in cool, dry place
- Use breathable storage bag
- Avoid plastic bags (traps moisture)

### Long-term:
- Acid-free tissue paper between folds
- Cedar chest or climate-controlled area
- Check periodically for moisture
- Refold occasionally to prevent creases

## Proper Folding:
The traditional triangle fold:
1. Fold in half lengthwise twice
2. Start triangle fold from striped end
3. Continue folding until only blue field shows
4. Tuck remaining fabric into fold

## Maintenance Schedule:
- **Weekly**: Visual inspection for damage
- **Monthly**: Check for fraying or fading
- **Quarterly**: Clean if soiled
- **Annually**: Deep clean and inspection

## When to Replace:
Replace your flag when:
- Colors are significantly faded
- Fabric is torn or frayed
- Stripes are separating
- Stars are damaged

**Flag showing wear?** See [My Flag Is Fraying](/help-center/troubleshooting/my-flag-is-fraying-what-can-i-do).

## Flag Quality Matters:
Higher quality flags last longer:
- **Nylon** - Best for most conditions, lightweight
- **Polyester** - Heavy-duty, high-wind areas
- **Cotton** - Traditional, indoor/ceremonial use

# Can I Fly a Flag at Night?

Yes! You can fly the American flag 24 hours a day if properly illuminated.

## The Rule:
According to U.S. Flag Code:
> "It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness."

## Illumination Requirements:

### What Qualifies as "Proper Illumination":
- Flag must be clearly visible
- Light should illuminate entire flag
- Brightness sufficient to see colors and details
- Consistent lighting (not flickering)

### Lighting Options:

**Solar Lights (Recommended)**:
- Included with Premier Kits
- Automatic on/off
- No wiring required
- Eco-friendly
- Low maintenance

**Spotlights**:
- Ground-mounted uplight
- 50-100 watt LED
- Aimed at flag
- Requires electrical outlet

**Pole-Mounted Lights**:
- Attaches to pole
- Downward-facing

- **Mountain areas** - Gusty conditions
- **Open plains** - Constant wind exposure
- **Hurricane zones** - Extreme weather events

### Recommendations:
- Consider shorter pole height
- Use smaller flag size
- Install with extra concrete
- Add anti-theft locking clamp

See [High-Wind Installation Tips](/help-center/product-setup/cold-weather-installation).

## What About Hurricanes?

### Category 1-2 (74-110 MPH):
- Pole should withstand with proper installation
- Consider lowering flag
- Monitor conditions

### Category 3+ (111+ MPH):
- Lower pole if possible
- Remove flag
- Secure loose items
- Follow evacuation orders

## 100 MPH Wind Guarantee:

    content: `
# Can I Install on a Slope?

Yes, you can install on a slope with proper techniques.

## Key Principle:
**The flagpole must be perfectly vertical**, regardless of ground slope.

## Installation on Slopes:

### Mild Slopes (up to 15¬∞):
- Dig hole perpendicular to slope
- Use longer level for accuracy
- May need extra concrete on downhill side
- Relatively straightforward

### Moderate Slopes (15-30¬∞):
- Consider terracing installation area
- Build up low side with retaining wall
- Use transit level for precision
- Professional help recommended

### Steep Slopes (30¬∞+):
- Terracing required
- Significant excavation needed
- Professional installation strongly recommended
- Consider alternative location

## Step-by-Step for Sloped Installation:

### 1. Choose Location:
- Avoid steepest part of slope if possible
- Consider drainage patterns
- Ensure clearance for flag
- Check for underground utilities

### 2. Prepare Site:
- Mark pole location
- Use transit level or laser level
- Dig hole perpendicular to true vertical (not slope)
- May need to excavate more on uphill side

### 3. Set Ground Sleeve:
- Use long level (4-6 feet recommended)
- Check vertical in multiple directions
- Brace securely while pouring concrete
- Double-check level as concrete sets

### 4. Pour Concrete:
- May need more concrete on downhill side
- Ensure sleeve remains vertical
- Slope concrete away from sleeve for drainage
- Allow extra cure time on slopes

### 5. Final Check:
- Verify vertical alignment
- Check from multiple angles
- Make adjustments before concrete fully cures
- Document installation with photos

## Tools for Sloped Installation:

### Essential:
- 4-6 foot level
- Transit level or laser level
- Plumb bob
- Measuring tape
- Stakes and string

### Helpful:
- Post level (attaches to pole)
- Digital angle finder
- Extra bracing materials
- Helper (highly recommended)

## Drainage Considerations:
- Water should flow away from pole
- Slope concrete surface appropriately
- Consider French drain if needed
- Prevent water pooling around base

## Common Mistakes:

### Don't:
- Install perpendicular to slope (pole will lean)
- Eyeball the vertical alignment
- Rush the concrete curing
- Ignore drainage issues

### Do:
- Use proper leveling tools
- Take your time
- Check vertical from multiple angles
- Plan for drainage

## Alternative Solutions:

### If Slope Is Too Steep:
1. **Terrace the area** - Create level platform
2. **Retaining wall** - Build up low side
3. **Different location** - Find flatter spot
4. **Deck mount** - Install on level deck/patio

### Deck/Patio Mounting:
- Requires deck mount kit (sold separately)
- Must be level surface
- Structural support required
- Professional installation recommended

## Professional Installation:
Consider professional help if:
- Slope exceeds 20¬∞
- You're unsure about leveling
- Significant excavation needed
- Local codes require it

## Warranty Considerations:
- Proper vertical installation required
- Improper installation voids warranty
- Document installation process
- Contact us with questions before installing

**Need installation help?** Contact our support team at 1-800-XXX-XXXX or see our [Installation Guide](/help-center/getting-started/how-to-install-your-phoenix-telescoping-flagpole).

## Success Tips:
- Measure twice, dig once
- Use quality leveling tools
- Don't rush the process
- Ask for help if needed
- When in doubt, call us!
