3. Click **Add menu item** under that parent

## Suggested Menu Placement

We recommend placing "Shop by State" in one of these locations:

- **Top-level menu item** (most visible)
- Under "Flags" dropdown
- Under "Shop" dropdown
- As a promotional banner link

## URL Structure

- Main page: `/capitals`
- Individual states: `/capitals/[state-code]` (e.g., `/capitals/tx` for Texas)

All 50 states are available with their two-letter state codes in lowercase.
